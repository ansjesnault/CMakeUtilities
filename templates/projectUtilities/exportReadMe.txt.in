Here, for @PACKAGE_NAME@, Use_@PACKAGE_NAME@.cmake file and @PACKAGE_NAME@Config.cmake file allow others end-users to include @PACKAGE_NAME@ into theire own project.

All user have to do is to include the Use@PACKAGE_NAME@.cmake file into theire own CMakeLists.txt instead of using a Find@PACKAGE_NAME@.cmake module.

Piece of code:
find_package(@PACKAGE_NAME@) # you may need to use NO_MODULE flag
if(@PACKAGE_NAME@_FOUND)
    if(USE_@PACKAGE_NAME@)
        include(${USE_@PACKAGE_NAME@}))
    endif()
endif()

This allow you to get (imported) directly all targets from @PACKAGE_NAME@ into your CMake project.
So it's not anymore a FindPackageModule.cmake which try to find all @PACKAGE_NAME@ targets but @PACKAGE_NAME@ which provide a way to get it with this file ! cool!
